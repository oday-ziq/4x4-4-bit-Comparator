Gate Diffusion Input (GDI) technology offers an efficient alternative for low power VLSI applications, enabling circuits with significantly fewer transistors compared to traditional methods. This paper presents GDI cells applied to combinational circuits, including a novel low-power XOR design using only nMOS transistors.
